## How to use goldfish-gatherer

<br/>

Just boot the script up (preferably through cmd so you get the progress reporting) and enter the url of your
advanced gatherer search. Press "Get List" and the window will disappear. Now it's the waiting game. This could
take anywhere from seconds to minutes to hours. The general rule is 2-3 seconds per individual card in the search.

### Possible improvements

<br/>

1.Add description parser to read alt text.
2.Add excel outputting so that output document is formatted nicely.
4.Finally, make a more complete program. Perhaps a web application.
